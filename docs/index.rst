aldsim's documentation
======================

aldsim provides a suite of simple models for atomic layer deposition
processes.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a thin film growth technique that
relies on self-limited surface kinetics. It plays a key role
in areas such as microelectronics, and it is applied for energy,
energy storage, catalysis, and decarbonization applications.

aldsim implements a series of models to help explore ALD in 
various contexts and reactor configurations.

It has grown from a collection of papers that we have published over
the past 10 years.
