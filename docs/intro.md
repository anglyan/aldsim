# About aldsim

## Basic structure

aldsim provides two separate functionalities: its `core` module contains
various models implemented using nondimensional variables. These models
highlight some of the scaling laws in atomic layer deposition. 

Through its chem module, it applies the models in `core` to various idealized
models of self-limited surface kinetics.


## Status


`aldsim` is still in development. Over the next few months it will
be expanded to incorporate a variety of models.

## Quick install

Through pypi:

```
pip install aldsim
```

Alternatively, it can be directly installed from its github repository: https://github.com/anglyan/aldsim
